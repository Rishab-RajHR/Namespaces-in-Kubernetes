Namespaces in Kubernetes are used to logically divide cluster resources for better organization.

They help isolate environments like development, testing, and production within the same cluster.

Each namespace can have its own pods, services, deployments, and configurations.

Methods (kubectl commands) are used to manage namespaces and resources.

Common commands include creating, listing, describing, and deleting namespaces.

Namespaces improve resource management, security, and access control.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can be applied per namespace.

System namespaces like kube-system handle internal Kubernetes components.

Using namespaces makes large Kubernetes clusters easier to manage and scale.
